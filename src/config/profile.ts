  // Bio/About summary
  bio: `As a software engineer with 10 years of experience, I've built my career on a core belief: that the most powerful systems are defined by their human experience.

This principle, shaped by my background in psychology, drives me to bridge the divide between complex software architecture and elegant, intuitive user interfaces.

I put this philosophy into practice across the full stack—delivering modern frontend applications, designing robust APIs, and building scalable distributed systems. I'm now keenly focused on applying this user-centric approach to AI, ensuring intelligent systems are not only powerful but also accessible and intuitive.

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
• Playing retro video games (hence this portfolio!)
• Exploring the Swiss Alps
• Learning about AI and emerging technologies`,
